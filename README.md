# scratchpad

This is my small starter for all react projects that I work on.  Feel free to use it as a base and
adapt it to your needs.  If there's something you don't like: Shoot me an issue.

# Use

This is a [khaos](https://github.com/segmentio/khaos) template.  Install this first and then
generate an app using the following command.

    $ khaos create domachine/scratchpad myapp

Replace `myapp` with your project name.

# Start

Spin the development server using:

    $ npm start

# Tests

I like to wave tests side by side with my code.  Everything which is named with `_test.js` in the
end, is run using [tap](https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap) with the following command:

    $ npm test

Happy hacking!
